# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented here. Per-tool history (version bumps, reference refreshes) remains in `skills/<tool>/CHANGELOG.md`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) at the repo level: patch for documentation-only fixes, minor for new skills or substantial README/layout updates, major for breaking changes to install paths or skill layout.

## [Unreleased]
