### `intersect`

```

Tool:    bedtools intersect (aka intersectBed)
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: Report overlaps between two feature files.

Usage:   bedtools intersect [OPTIONS] -a <bed/gff/vcf/bam> -b <bed/gff/vcf/bam>

	Note: -b may be followed with multiple databases and/or 
	wildcard (*) character(s). 
Options: 
	-wa	Write the original entry in A for each overlap.

	-wb	Write the original entry in B for each overlap.
		- Useful for knowing _what_ A overlaps. Restricted by -f and -r.

	-loj	Perform a "left outer join". That is, for each feature in A
		report each overlap with B.  If no overlaps are found, 
		report a NULL feature for B.

	-wo	Write the original A and B entries plus the number of base
		pairs of overlap between the two features.
		- Overlaps restricted by -f and -r.
		  Only A features with overlap are reported.

	-wao	Write the original A and B entries plus the number of base
		pairs of overlap between the two features.
		- Overlapping features restricted by -f and -r.
		  However, A features w/o overlap are also reported
		  with a NULL B feature and overlap = 0.

	-u	Write the original A entry _once_ if _any_ overlaps found in B.
		- In other words, just report the fact >=1 hit was found.
		- Overlaps restricted by -f and -r.

	-c	For each entry in A, report the number of overlaps with B.
		- Reports 0 for A entries that have no overlap with B.
		- Overlaps restricted by -f, -F, -r, and -s.

	-C	For each entry in A, separately report the number of
		- overlaps with each B file on a distinct line.
		- Reports 0 for A entries that have no overlap with B.
		- Overlaps restricted by -f, -F, -r, and -s.

	-v	Only report those entries in A that have _no overlaps_ with B.
		- Similar to "grep -v" (an homage).

	-ubam	Write uncompressed BAM output. Default writes compressed BAM.

	-s	Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
		that overlap A on the _same_ strand.
		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

	-S	Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
		that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

	-f	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-F	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-r	Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B.
		- In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
		  that B overlap 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.

	-e	Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B.
		- In other words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires
		  that either 90% of A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered.
		  Without -e, both fractions would have to be satisfied.

	-split	Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.

	-g	Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order
		across input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.

	-nonamecheck	For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming conventions
			for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".

	-sorted	Use the "chromsweep" algorithm for sorted (-k1,1 -k2,2n) input.

	-names	When using multiple databases, provide an alias for each that
		will appear instead of a fileId when also printing the DB record.

	-filenames	When using multiple databases, show each complete filename
			instead of a fileId when also printing the DB record.

	-sortout	When using multiple databases, sort the output DB hits
			for each record.

	-bed	If using BAM input, write output as BED.

	-header	Print the header from the A file prior to results.

	-nobuf	Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line
		of output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved
		in a buffer. This will make printing large output files 
		noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with
		other software tools and scripts that need to process one
		line of bedtools output at a time.

	-iobuf	Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.
		Takes an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.
		Note: currently has no effect with compressed files.

Notes: 
	(1) When a BAM file is used for the A file, the alignment is retained if overlaps exist,
	and excluded if an overlap cannot be found.  If multiple overlaps exist, they are not
	reported, as we are only testing for one or more overlaps.
```

### `closest`

```

Tool:    bedtools closest (aka closestBed)
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: For each feature in A, finds the closest 
	 feature (upstream or downstream) in B.

Usage:   bedtools closest [OPTIONS] -a <bed/gff/vcf> -b <bed/gff/vcf>

Options: 
	-d	In addition to the closest feature in B, 
		report its distance to A as an extra column.
		- The reported distance for overlapping features will be 0.

	-D	Like -d, report the closest feature in B, and its distance to A
		as an extra column. Unlike -d, use negative distances to report
		upstream features.
		The options for defining which orientation is "upstream" are:
		- "ref"   Report distance with respect to the reference genome. 
		            B features with a lower (start, stop) are upstream
		- "a"     Report distance with respect to A.
		            When A is on the - strand, "upstream" means B has a
		            higher (start,stop).
		- "b"     Report distance with respect to B.
		            When B is on the - strand, "upstream" means A has a
		            higher (start,stop).

	-io	Ignore features in B that overlap A.  That is, we want close,
		yet not touching features only.

	-iu	Ignore features in B that are upstream of features in A.
		This option requires -D and follows its orientation
		rules for determining what is "upstream".

	-id	Ignore features in B that are downstream of features in A.

		- "first"  Report the first tie that occurred in the B file.
		- "last"   Report the last tie that occurred in the B file.

	-mdb	How multiple databases are resolved.
		- "each"    Report closest records for each database (default).
		- "all"  Report closest records among all databases.

	-k	Report the k closest hits. Default is 1. If tieMode = "all", 
		- all ties will still be reported.

	-N	Require that the query and the closest hit have different names.
		For BED, the 4th column is compared.

	-s	Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
		that overlap A on the _same_ strand.
		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

	-S	Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
		that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

	-f	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-F	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).

		- In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
		  that B overlap 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.

	-e	Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B.
		- In other words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires
		  that either 90% of A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered.
		  Without -e, both fractions would have to be satisfied.

	-split	Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.

	-g	Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order
		across input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.

	-nonamecheck	For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming conventions
			for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".

	-names	When using multiple databases, provide an alias for each that
		will appear instead of a fileId when also printing the DB record.

	-filenames	When using multiple databases, show each complete filename
			instead of a fileId when also printing the DB record.

	-sortout	When using multiple databases, sort the output DB hits
			for each record.

	-bed	If using BAM input, write output as BED.

	-header	Print the header from the A file prior to results.

	-nobuf	Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line
		of output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved
		in a buffer. This will make printing large output files 
		noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with
		other software tools and scripts that need to process one
		line of bedtools output at a time.

	-iobuf	Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.
		Takes an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.
		Note: currently has no effect with compressed files.

Notes: 
	Reports "none" for chrom and "-1" for all other fields when a feature
	is not found in B on the same chromosome as the feature in A.
	E.g. none	-1	-1

		  4) % of A at depth

	-d	Report the depth at each position in each A feature.
		Positions reported are one based.  Each position
		and depth follow the complete A feature.

	-counts	Only report the count of overlaps, don't compute fraction, etc.

	-mean	Report the mean depth of all positions in each A feature.

	-s	Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B

		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-F	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-r	Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B.
		- In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
		  that B overlap 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.

	-e	Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B.
		- In other words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires
		  that either 90% of A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered.
		  Without -e, both fractions would have to be satisfied.

	-split	Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.

	-g	Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order
		across input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.

	-nonamecheck	For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming conventions

		Default: 5.
		Multiple columns can be specified in a comma-delimited list.

	-o	Specify the operation that should be applied to -c.
		Valid operations:
		    sum, min, max, absmin, absmax,

		    first (i.e., just the first value in the column), 
		    last (i.e., just the last value in the column), 
		Default: sum
		Multiple operations can be specified in a comma-delimited list.

		If there is only column, but multiple operations, all operations will be
		applied on that column. Likewise, if there is only one operation, but
		multiple columns, that operation will be applied to all columns.
		Otherwise, the number of columns must match the the number of operations,
		and will be applied in respective order.
		E.g., "-c 5,4,6 -o sum,mean,count" will give the sum of column 5,
		the mean of column 4, and the count of column 6.

		that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

	-f	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-F	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-r	Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B.
		- In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
		  that B overlap 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.

	-e	Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B.
		- In other words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires
		  that either 90% of A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered.
		  Without -e, both fractions would have to be satisfied.

	-split	Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.

	-g	Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order
		across input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.

	-nonamecheck	For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming conventions
			for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".

	-bed	If using BAM input, write output as BED.

		line of bedtools output at a time.

	-iobuf	Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.
		Takes an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.
		Note: currently has no effect with compressed files.

Notes: 
	(1) Both input files must be sorted by chrom, then start.
```

### `genomecov`

```

*****ERROR: Unrecognized parameter: --help *****


*****
*****ERROR: Need both a BED (-i) and a genome (-g) file. 
*****

Tool:    bedtools genomecov (aka genomeCoverageBed)
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: Compute the coverage of a feature file among a genome.

Usage: bedtools genomecov [OPTIONS] -i <bed/gff/vcf> -g <genome> OR -ibam <bam/cram>

Options: 
	-ibam		The input file is in BAM format.
			Note: BAM _must_ be sorted by position

	-g		Provide a genome file to define chromosome lengths.
			Note:Required when not using -ibam option.

	-d		Report the depth at each genome position (with one-based coordinates).
			Default behavior is to report a histogram.

	-dz		Report the depth at each genome position (with zero-based coordinates).
			Reports only non-zero positions.
			Default behavior is to report a histogram.

	-bg		Report depth in BedGraph format. For details, see:
			genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html

	-bga		Report depth in BedGraph format, as above (-bg).
			However with this option, regions with zero 
			coverage are also reported. This allows one to
			quickly extract all regions of a genome with 0 
			coverage by applying: "grep -w 0$" to the output.

	-split		Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.
			when computing coverage.
			For BAM files, this uses the CIGAR "N" and "D" operations 
			to infer the blocks for computing coverage.
			For BED12 files, this uses the BlockCount, BlockStarts, and BlockEnds
			fields (i.e., columns 10,11,12).

	-ignoreD	Ignore local deletions (CIGAR "D" operations) in BAM entries
			when computing coverage.

	-strand		Calculate coverage of intervals from a specific strand.
			With BED files, requires at least 6 columns (strand is column 6). 
			- (STRING): can be + or -

	-pc		Calculate coverage of pair-end fragments.
			Works for BAM files only
	-fs		Force to use provided fragment size instead of read length
			Works for BAM files only
	-du		Change strand af the mate read (so both reads from the same strand) useful for strand specific
			Works for BAM files only
	-5		Calculate coverage of 5" positions (instead of entire interval).

	-3		Calculate coverage of 3" positions (instead of entire interval).

	-max		Combine all positions with a depth >= max into
			a single bin in the histogram. Irrelevant
			for -d and -bedGraph
			- (INTEGER)

	-scale		Scale the coverage by a constant factor.
			Each coverage value is multiplied by this factor before being reported.
			Useful for normalizing coverage by, e.g., reads per million (RPM).
			- Default is 1.0; i.e., unscaled.
			- (FLOAT)

	-trackline	Adds a UCSC/Genome-Browser track line definition in the first line of the output.
			- See here for more details about track line definition:
			      http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bedgraph.html
			- NOTE: When adding a trackline definition, the output BedGraph can be easily
			      uploaded to the Genome Browser as a custom track,
			      BUT CAN NOT be converted into a BigWig file (w/o removing the first line).

	-trackopts	Writes additional track line definition parameters in the first line.
			- Example:
			   -trackopts 'name="My Track" visibility=2 color=255,30,30'
			   Note the use of single-quotes if you have spaces in your parameters.
			- (TEXT)

Notes: 
	(1) The genome file should tab delimited and structured as follows:
	 <chromName><TAB><chromSize>

	For example, Human (hg19):
	chr1	249250621
	chr2	243199373
	...
	chr18_gl000207_random	4262

	(2) The input BED (-i) file must be grouped by chromosome.
	 A simple "sort -k 1,1 <BED> > <BED>.sorted" will suffice.

	(3) The input BAM (-ibam) file must be sorted by position.
	 A "samtools sort <BAM>" should suffice.

Tip 1. Use samtools faidx to create a genome file from a FASTA: 
	One can the samtools faidx command to index a FASTA file.
	The resulting .fai index is suitable as a genome file, 
	as bedtools will only look at the first two, relevant columns
	of the .fai file.

	For example:
	samtools faidx GRCh38.fa
	bedtools genomecov -i my.bed -g GRCh38.fa.fai

Tip 2. Use UCSC Table Browser to create a genome file: 
	One can use the UCSC Genome Browser's MySQL database to extract
	chromosome sizes. For example, H. sapiens:

	mysql --user=genome --host=genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu -A -e \
	"select chrom, size from hg19.chromInfo"  > hg19.genome
```

### `merge`

```

Tool:    bedtools merge (aka mergeBed)

		that are on the same strand.
		- By default, merging is done without respect to strand.

	-S	Force merge for one specific strand only.
		Follow with + or - to force merge from only
		the forward or reverse strand, respectively.
		- By default, merging is done without respect to strand.

	-d	Maximum distance between features allowed for features
		to be merged.
		- Def. 0. That is, overlapping & book-ended features are merged.
		- (INTEGER)
		- Note: negative values enforce the number of b.p. required for overlap.

	-c	Specify columns from the B file to map onto intervals in A.
		Default: 5.
		Multiple columns can be specified in a comma-delimited list.

	-o	Specify the operation that should be applied to -c.
		Valid operations:
		    sum, min, max, absmin, absmax,
		    mean, median, mode, antimode
		    stdev, sstdev
		    collapse (i.e., print a delimited list (duplicates allowed)), 
		    distinct (i.e., print a delimited list (NO duplicates allowed)), 
		    distinct_sort_num (as distinct, sorted numerically, ascending),
		    distinct_sort_num_desc (as distinct, sorted numerically, desscending),
		    distinct_only (delimited list of only unique values),
		    count
		    count_distinct (i.e., a count of the unique values in the column), 
		    first (i.e., just the first value in the column), 
		    last (i.e., just the last value in the column), 
		Default: sum

		If there is only column, but multiple operations, all operations will be
		applied on that column. Likewise, if there is only one operation, but
		multiple columns, that operation will be applied to all columns.
		Otherwise, the number of columns must match the the number of operations,
		and will be applied in respective order.
		E.g., "-c 5,4,6 -o sum,mean,count" will give the sum of column 5,
		the mean of column 4, and the count of column 6.
		The order of output columns will match the ordering given in the command.


	-delim	Specify a custom delimiter for the collapse operations.
		- Example: -delim "|"
		- Default: ",".

	-prec	Sets the decimal precision for output (Default: 5)

	-bed	If using BAM input, write output as BED.

	-header	Print the header from the A file prior to results.

	-nobuf	Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line
		of output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved
		in a buffer. This will make printing large output files 
		noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with
		other software tools and scripts that need to process one
		line of bedtools output at a time.

	-iobuf	Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.
		Takes an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.
		Note: currently has no effect with compressed files.

Notes: 
	(1) The input file (-i) file must be sorted by chrom, then start.

	samtools faidx GRCh38.fa
	bedtools complement -i my.bed -g GRCh38.fa.fai

Tip 2. Use UCSC Table Browser to create a genome file: 
	One can use the UCSC Genome Browser's MySQL database to extract
	chromosome sizes. For example, H. sapiens:

	mysql --user=genome --host=genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu -A -e \
	"select chrom, size from hg19.chromInfo"  > hg19.genome

		E.g. if used on a 1000bp feature, -s 0.50, 
		will shift the feature 500 bp "upstream".  Default = false.

	-header	Print the header from the input file prior to results.

Notes: 
	(1)  Starts will be set to 0 if options would force it below 0.
	(2)  Ends will be set to the chromosome length if  requested slop would
	force it above the max chrom length.
	(3)  The genome file should tab delimited and structured as follows:

### `subtract`

```

Tool:    bedtools subtract (aka subtractBed)
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: Removes the portion(s) of an interval that is overlapped
	 by another feature(s).

Usage:   bedtools subtract [OPTIONS] -a <bed/gff/vcf> -b <bed/gff/vcf>

Options: 
	-A	Remove entire feature if any overlap.  That is, by default,
		only subtract the portion of A that overlaps B. Here, if
		any overlap is found (or -f amount), the entire feature is removed.

	-N	Same as -A except when used with -f, the amount is the sum
		of all features (not any single feature).

	-wb	Write the original entry in B for each overlap.
		- Useful for knowing _what_ A overlaps. Restricted by -f and -r.

	-wo	Write the original A and B entries plus the number of base
		pairs of overlap between the two features.
		- Overlaps restricted by -f and -r.
		  Only A features with overlap are reported.

	-s	Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
		that overlap A on the _same_ strand.
		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

	-S	Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B
		that overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.
		- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.

	-f	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-F	Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B.
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-r	Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B.
		- In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires
		  that B overlap 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.

	-e	Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B.
		- In other words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires
		  that either 90% of A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered.
		  Without -e, both fractions would have to be satisfied.

	-split	Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.

	-g	Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order
		across input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.

	-nonamecheck	For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming conventions
			for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".

	-sorted	Use the "chromsweep" algorithm for sorted (-k1,1 -k2,2n) input.

	-bed	If using BAM input, write output as BED.

	-header	Print the header from the A file prior to results.

	-nobuf	Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line
		of output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved
		in a buffer. This will make printing large output files 
		noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with
		other software tools and scripts that need to process one
		line of bedtools output at a time.

Usage:   bedtools shuffle [OPTIONS] -i <bed/gff/vcf> -g <genome>

Options: 
	-excl	A BED/GFF/VCF file of coordinates in which features in -i
		should not be placed (e.g. gaps.bed).

	-incl	Instead of randomly placing features in a genome, the -incl
		options defines a BED/GFF/VCF file of coordinates in which 
		features in -i should be randomly placed (e.g. genes.bed). 
		Larger -incl intervals will contain more shuffled regions. 
		This method DISABLES -chromFirst. 
	-chrom	Keep features in -i on the same chromosome.
		- By default, the chrom and position are randomly chosen.
		- NOTE: Forces use of -chromFirst (see below).

	-seed	Supply an integer seed for the shuffling.
		- By default, the seed is chosen automatically.
		- (INTEGER)

	-f	Maximum overlap (as a fraction of the -i feature) with an -excl
		feature that is tolerated before searching for a new, 
		randomized locus. For example, -f 0.10 allows up to 10%
		of a randomized feature to overlap with a given feature
		in the -excl file. **Cannot be used with -incl file.**
		- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).
		- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

	-chromFirst	
		Instead of choosing a position randomly among the entire
		genome (the default), first choose a chrom randomly, and then
		choose a random start coordinate on that chrom.  This leads
		to features being ~uniformly distributed among the chroms,
		as opposed to features being distribute as a function of chrom size.

	-bedpe	Indicate that the A file is in BEDPE format.

	-maxTries	
		Max. number of attempts to find a home for a shuffled interval
		in the presence of -incl or -excl.
		Default = 1000.
	-noOverlapping	
		Don't allow shuffled intervals to overlap.
	-allowBeyondChromEnd	
		Allow shuffled intervals to be relocated to a position
		in which the entire original interval cannot fit w/o exceeding
		the end of the chromosome.  In this case, the end coordinate of the
		shuffled interval will be set to the chromosome's length.
		By default, an interval's original length must be fully-contained
		within the chromosome.
Notes: 
	(1)  The genome file should tab delimited and structured as follows:
	     <chromName><TAB><chromSize>

	For example, Human (hg19):

	-header	Print the header from the input file prior to results.

	-bed	If using BAM input, write output as BED.

	-header	Print the header from the A file prior to results.

	-nobuf	Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line

	chr2	243199373
	...
	chr18_gl000207_random	4262

Tip 1. Use samtools faidx to create a genome file from a FASTA: 
	One can the samtools faidx command to index a FASTA file.
	The resulting .fai index is suitable as a genome file, 
	as bedtools will only look at the first two, relevant columns
	of the .fai file.

	For example:
	samtools faidx GRCh38.fa
	bedtools makewindows -w 100 -g GRCh38.fa.fai

Tip 2. Use UCSC Table Browser to create a genome file: 
	One can use the UCSC Genome Browser's MySQL database to extract
	chromosome sizes. For example, H. sapiens:

	mysql --user=genome --host=genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu -A -e \
	"select chrom, size from hg19.chromInfo"  > hg19.genome

Examples: 
 # Divide the human genome into windows of 1MB:
 $ bedtools makewindows -g hg19.txt -w 1000000
 chr1 0 1000000
 chr1 1000000 2000000
 chr1 2000000 3000000
 chr1 3000000 4000000
 chr1 4000000 5000000
 ...

 # Divide the human genome into sliding (=overlapping) windows of 1MB, with 500KB overlap:
 $ bedtools makewindows -g hg19.txt -w 1000000 -s 500000
 chr1 0 1000000
 chr1 500000 1500000
 chr1 1000000 2000000
 chr1 1500000 2500000
 chr1 2000000 3000000
 ...

 # Divide each chromosome in human genome to 1000 windows of equal size:
 $ bedtools makewindows -g hg19.txt -n 1000
 chr1 0 249251
 chr1 249251 498502
 chr1 498502 747753

### `groupby`

```

Tool:    bedtools groupby 
Version: v2.31.1
Summary: Summarizes a dataset column based upon
	 common column groupings. Akin to the SQL "group by" command.

Usage:	 bedtools groupby -g [group_column(s)] -c [op_column(s)] -o [ops] 
	 cat [FILE] | bedtools groupby -g [group_column(s)] -c [op_column(s)] -o [ops] 

Options: 
	-i		Input file. Assumes "stdin" if omitted.

	-g -grp		Specify the columns (1-based) for the grouping.
			The columns must be comma separated.
			- Default: 1,2,3

	-c -opCols	Specify the column (1-based) that should be summarized.
			- Required.

	-o -ops		Specify the operation that should be applied to opCol.
			Valid operations:
			    sum, count, count_distinct, min, max,
			    mean, median, mode, antimode,
			    stdev, sstdev (sample standard dev.),
			    collapse (i.e., print a comma separated list (duplicates allowed)), 
			    distinct (i.e., print a comma separated list (NO duplicates allowed)), 
			    distinct_sort_num (as distinct, but sorted numerically, ascending), 
			    distinct_sort_num_desc (as distinct, but sorted numerically, descending), 
			    concat   (i.e., merge values into a single, non-delimited string), 
			    freqdesc (i.e., print desc. list of values:freq)
			    freqasc (i.e., print asc. list of values:freq)
			    first (i.e., print first value)
			    last (i.e., print last value)
			- Default: sum

		If there is only column, but multiple operations, all operations will be
		applied on that column. Likewise, if there is only one operation, but
		multiple columns, that operation will be applied to all columns.
		Otherwise, the number of columns must match the the number of operations,
		and will be applied in respective order.
		E.g., "-c 5,4,6 -o sum,mean,count" will give the sum of column 5,
		the mean of column 4, and the count of column 6.
		The order of output columns will match the ordering given in the command.


	-full		Print all columns from input file.  The first line in the group is used.
			Default: print only grouped columns.

	-inheader	Input file has a header line - the first line will be ignored.

	-outheader	Print header line in the output, detailing the column names. 
			If the input file has headers (-inheader), the output file
			will use the input's column names.
			If the input file has no headers, the output file
			will use "col_1", "col_2", etc. as the column names.

	-header		same as '-inheader -outheader'

	-ignorecase	Group values regardless of upper/lower case.

	-prec	Sets the decimal precision for output (Default: 5)

	-delim	Specify a custom delimiter for the collapse operations.
		- Example: -delim "|"
		- Default: ",".

Examples: 
	$ cat ex1.out
	chr1 10  20  A   chr1    15  25  B.1 1000    ATAT
	chr1 10  20  A   chr1    25  35  B.2 10000   CGCG

	$ groupBy -i ex1.out -g 1,2,3,4 -c 9 -o sum
	chr1 10  20  A   11000

	$ groupBy -i ex1.out -grp 1,2,3,4 -opCols 9,9 -ops sum,max
	chr1 10  20  A   11000   10000

	$ groupBy -i ex1.out -g 1,2,3,4 -c 8,9 -o collapse,mean
	chr1 10  20  A   B.1,B.2,    5500

	$ cat ex1.out | groupBy -g 1,2,3,4 -c 8,9 -o collapse,mean
	chr1 10  20  A   B.1,B.2,    5500

	$ cat ex1.out | groupBy -g 1,2,3,4 -c 10 -o concat
	chr1 10  20  A   ATATCGCG

Notes: 
	(1)  The input file/stream should be sorted/grouped by the -grp. columns
	(2)  If -i is unspecified, input is assumed to come from stdin.
```
